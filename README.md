#REAMDE file for the publication "Stoichiometric correlation analysis: towards principles of metabolic functionality from metabolomics data"

## The folder "Functions" contains the following R-function files 

1. divisors  
2. ks_stoichiometric_correlation
3. ks_find_max_cor_tr
4. ks_find_max_cor_qu
5. ks_pairwise_cor
6. ks_find_max_cor
7. ks_make_table
8. ks_shared_cluster
9. write_list
10. ks_make_bipartite_graph

## And Pyhton scripts
11. File_read_triples.py
12. File_read_quadruples.py

## An example script, which explains in which order the functions need to be called.

## "Example_Data+Script"
The folder coontains example data from the publications Caldana et al. and Jozefzcuk et al.. The data contain only the overlapping metabolites, also analyzed in the publication.
