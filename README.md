#REAMDE file for the publication "Stoichiometric correlation analysis: towards principles of metabolic functionality from metabolomics data"

## The folder "Functions" contains the following R-function files 

*divisors <- number of metabolites
*ks_stoichiometric_correlation
*ks_find_max_cor_tr
*ks_find_max_cor_qu
*ks_pairwise_cor
*ks_find_max_cor
*ks_make_table
*ks_shared_cluster
*write_list
*ks_make_bipartite_graph

## And Pyhton scripts
*File_read_triples.py
*File_read_quadruples.py

## An example script, which explains in which order the functions need to be called.

## "Example_Data+Script"
The folder coontains example data from the publications Caldana et al. and Jozefzcuk et al.. The data contain only the overlapping metabolites, also analyzed in the publication.
Next to the data is a bash-script, which calls all R and Python functions and performs the complete analysis of the data
